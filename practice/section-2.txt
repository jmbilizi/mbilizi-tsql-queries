Practice Section 2

- Writing mathematical queries

Open up SQL Server Management Studio, if it's not already open, and start a new Query.

Write statements which calculate the following:

1. What is 4 plus 9? Please call the column MyAnswer.
2. What is 15 minus 26? Please call the column Balance.
3. What is 24 times 4 plus 3? Please call the column MyResponse.
4. What is 48 divided by 4? Please call the column Result.

Then run these statements - and check your answers and make sure they are right.
