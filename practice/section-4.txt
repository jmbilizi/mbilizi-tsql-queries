Practice Section 4 (A)

Now itÂ´s your turn.

Can you create a variable of the data type that allows values up to 32,767, but no further.

Then assign the variable the value of 20,000

And then print out the contents of that variable.

Afterwards:

Create version 2: Change your code so that it tries to assign the value of 200,000. If it doesn't run properly, then you got it right.

Create version 3: Correct the problem by changing your variable to a data type that allows the value of 200,000, and see if the code now works.

Create version 4: Then change it back to 20,000, but change the variable to a data type that doesn't allow numbers that high. Then see if you get that error message again.



And if you have having problems remembering which data type is which, try remembers that acronym which lists this in the right order.
